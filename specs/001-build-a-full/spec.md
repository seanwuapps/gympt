# Feature Specification: AI Personal Training Companion

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-full`  
**Created**: September 22, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "build a full stack AI-based application: a personal training companion that generates, manages, and tracks strength-training workouts tailored to each user, it should also provide time-based analytics for the user to see their progress and after each training session is finished, the ai should provide the user with a quick summary of the session. The UI should be mobile-first and extremely simple (only show what the user needs to see at the time of interaction) since a lot of the use case involves user being in the gym working out."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a gym-goer, I want an AI-powered training companion that creates personalized strength training workouts and tracks my progress, so I can effectively achieve my fitness goals with minimal interface interactions while at the gym.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new user, **When** they first access the system, **Then** they should be prompted to provide their fitness goals and training preferences
2. **Given** a user ready to work out, **When** they start a session, **Then** they should see a clear, tailored workout plan for the day
3. **Given** a user during a workout, **When** they complete an exercise, **Then** they should be able to quickly log their performance with minimal interaction
4. **Given** a completed workout session, **When** the user finishes their last exercise, **Then** they should receive an AI-generated summary of their performance
5. **Given** a user reviewing their progress, **When** they access their analytics, **Then** they should see clear visualizations of their improvement over time

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user needs to skip or modify an exercise during a workout?
- How does the system handle incomplete workout sessions?
- What happens if the user loses internet connectivity during a workout?
- How does the system adapt if a user consistently underperforms or overperforms?
- What happens when the user wants to switch their fitness goals mid-program?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST create personalized training plans based on user's fitness goals and preferences
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a mobile-first, extremely minimalist interface optimized for gym use
- **FR-003**: System MUST track and record user training sessions (e.g. exercise, sets, reps, weights)
- **FR-004**: At the end of a user training session, System MUST present user with a summary highlighting key achievements and areas for improvement
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide time-based analytics showing user progress (e.g. how many training sessions in the last x days, progress % on user's current plan)
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to quickly log exercise completion with minimal interaction
- **FR-007**: System MUST intellegently update training plans based on user performance and progress
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to swap the exercises (generated from AI) in the currently planned training session.
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide real-time exercise guidance (before user starts the exercise, they should see the description of the exercise and YouTube video)
- **FR-010**: System MUST store user's training history and performance data until user choose to delete their historical training data.

### Key Entities

- **User**: Represents the gym-goer, including their profile, fitness goals (e.g. rehab, strength, fat loss, cardio), fitness level (e.g. max 1 rep for bench, deadlift and squats, cardio capabilities), preferred training days (e.g. Mon, Tues, Wed), preferred training methodology (e.g. progressive overload)
- **GeneratedTrainingPlan**: AI-generated high-level training plans for users to review and commit to, this should also include why AI thinks the plan will help the user. high-level means at this level, the plan includes total length (weeks), scheduled training days and rest days in a week (e.g. Mon - Wed training, Thu - Sun rest), the purpose of each training day, start date and end date of the plan. Users should be able to re-commit to previously finished training plan.
- **GeneratedTrainingSessionPlan**: AI-generated structured training session composed of exercises, sets, and performance targets
- **Exercise**: Individual training exercise with associated performance metrics
- **UserTrainingSession**: Records of completed training sessions including actual user performance data (sets, reps, duration etc)
- **Feedback**: System-generated insights, recommendations, and session summaries
- **ProgressMetrics**: Time-based analytics of user's performance across various exercises
