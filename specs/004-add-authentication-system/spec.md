# Feature Specification: Authentication System

**Feature Branch**: `004-add-authentication-system`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "add authentication system using nuxt supabase integration"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the training application, I want to create an account, sign in, and remain signed in securely so that I can access my personalized training data and features.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new visitor on the application, **When** they choose "Continue with Google" and complete provider consent, **Then** their account is created and they are signed in to the app.
2. **Given** a returning user, **When** they choose "Continue with Google", **Then** they are authenticated and redirected to the main dashboard or prior intended page.
3. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they select sign out, **Then** their session is terminated and protected pages become inaccessible until they sign in again.
4. **Given** a user with an expired session, **When** they navigate within the app, **Then** they are prompted to re-authenticate without losing unsaved work.
5. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they visit the sign-in page, **Then** they are redirected away from auth pages to an appropriate destination (e.g., dashboard).

### Edge Cases
- User cancels Google sign-in consent ‚Üí remain on the current page with a clear message; allow retry.
- Provider error or denial during sign-in ‚Üí show a clear error and allow retry.
- Google account email not verified by provider ‚Üí allow sign-in; no additional email verification required.
- Concurrent sessions per user ‚Üí allowed; no special handling.
- Account deletion request ‚Üí confirm irreversible action and remove access immediately; data handling follows existing organizational policy (outside this feature).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create accounts via a secure sign-up flow.
- **FR-002**: System MUST rely on trusted identity from the Google provider; no separate email verification flow is required.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to sign in with their Google account only (no email/password).
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to sign out and terminate their session.
 - **FR-007**: System MUST protect designated routes/features so that only authenticated users can access them.
 - **FR-008**: The application MUST clearly reflect authentication state and guard protected actions in the UI.
 - **FR-009**: System MUST rely on provider default throttling/rate limiting for authentication attempts; no app-side throttling.
 - **FR-010**: System WILL NOT maintain audit event logs as part of this feature.
 - **FR-011**: System MUST authenticate users via Google only.
 - **FR-012**: System WILL NOT require multi-factor authentication for this feature.
 - **FR-014**: System MUST rely on provider default session lifetime and renewal; no custom session policy.
 - **FR-015**: System MUST support email change with re-verification and reflect email verification status.
 - **FR-017**: System MUST provide user-initiated account deletion and/or data export in line with policy.
 - **FR-018**: System MUST present authentication UX that is accessible and localizable.
 - **FR-019**: System MUST prevent already-authenticated users from accessing sign-in/up pages (redirect appropriately).
 - **FR-020**: System MUST protect against common auth threats (e.g., CSRF on state-changing actions, reuse of expired tokens, credential stuffing via rate limits).

 ### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
 - **User**: Represents an end user of the app; key attributes include id, email, emailVerified, displayName, createdAt, status (active/blocked), consents.
 - **AuthSession**: Represents an authenticated session; key attributes include userId, issuedAt, expiresAt, lastActiveAt, deviceInfo.
